Custom weapons for me and my friends
Rosemary - Axe that shoot beams. If you hit the ground it will send entites around you flying. The axe can also be thrown 
Alex - fishing rod that throws entities 100 blocks behind you.
Brayden - Shield that stores damage. Damage stored can be used in a shockwave. 
Shane - Sword that can do chain damage i.e will increase damage the more you hit the same entity 
Korbin - Warlord Hammer that allows for splash attacks.
